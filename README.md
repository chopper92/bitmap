# bitmap

Bitmap Message project from The Big Book of Small Python Projects by Al Swiegert. 

The original source code is from https://inventwithpython.com/bitmapworld.txt and uses asterisks, but the purpose of the program is that
when prompted, "Enter the message to display with the bitmap", you can put whatever word or symbol you would like. It will then
print the bitmap of the globe utilizing the message you typed.
