# bitmap

Bitmap Message project from The Big Book of Small Python Projects by Al Swiegert. 

The original source code is from https://inventwithpython.com/bitmapworld.txt and uses asterisks.
The purpose of the program is that when prompted to enter in a message, you can put a word or symbol and it will
display a bitmap of the globe using whatever you typed in.
